# links2bookmarkForTumblr
Retrieve all Links' posts from a Tumblr site and export them as bookmarks  to your favorite browser! 
You need to provide your own Tumblr API key if you are going to deploy your own service.

An example deployed version can be played at http://links2bookmarksfortumblr.herokuapp.com/?tumblrurl=what.tumblr.com

note that tumblr.com can be ommited i.e http://links2bookmarksfortumblr.herokuapp.com/?tumblrurl=what is still valid.

note that to get the proper bookmark output, right click --> view page source --> copy the page source content to a html file. Or the output would not be read by Chrome.
