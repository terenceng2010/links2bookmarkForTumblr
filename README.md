# links2bookmarkForTumblr
Retrieve all Links' posts from a Tumblr site and export them as bookmarks  to your favorite browser! (not yet finished for the ouput, now just dump all link title and hyperlinks only...)
You need to provide your own Tumblr API key and your own tumblr blog url for now

A example deployed version can be played at http://links2bookmarksfortumblr.herokuapp.com/?tumblrurl=what.tumblr.com

note that tumblr.com can be ommited i.e http://links2bookmarksfortumblr.herokuapp.com/?tumblrurl=what is still valid.
